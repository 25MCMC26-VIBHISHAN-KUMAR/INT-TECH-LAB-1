            <h2>Deep Learning Mini Project Announcement</h2>
            <p class="date">Posted on <span class="bold">21 Jan 2026</span></p>
            <p>
                Today, the Deep Learning faculty member, Srinivasa Rao Battula, announced that we have to work on a mini project. The mini project must be based on a research paper published after 2023. If a program already exists, we must enhance that project; if it is not implemented, then we must implement it ourselves.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, this looks very challenging for me because I only know Python and some of its libraries. The project requires strong mathematics, especially topics like probability, vectors, calculus, statistics, machine learning, deep learning, and the use of deep learning libraries. At the same time, we also have to study other subjects, which makes it even more challenging since many of them are new to me.

            <h2>5 task in Web Development</h2>
            <p class="date">Posted on <span class="bold">19 Jan 2026</span></p>
            <p>
                In the first Web Development lab, the faculty member for Internet Technology, N. Rukma Rekha, gave us three tasks that required knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. I tried to complete them on time, but without proper knowledge of these technologies, it felt very difficult. Later, I found through a WhatsApp group poll that many of my batchmates were facing the same problem. Therefore, only two or three students were able to submit the tasks.
            </p>
            <p>
                Ma’am did not give any penalty for this and extended the deadline till next Saturday, but she also gave two more problems that require knowledge of JavaScript. In total, we now have to complete five tasks before Saturday.
